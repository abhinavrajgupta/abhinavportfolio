								<p>Hello! I'm Abhinav Raj Gupta, a Computer Science major with a Mathematics minor at Texas Tech University, set to graduate in December 2025. Originally from NepalðŸ‡³ðŸ‡µ, I moved to the USA to pursue higher education and broaden my horizons.<p>
								<p>My technical skills include programming in Java, C, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Python being my strongest language. I have over three years of experience working with machine learning algorithms, particularly the YOLO algorithm for object detection projects. Throughout my college years, I have been a part of the Advanced Particle Detector Laboratory, a manufacturing center for silicon detectors used in the Large Hadron Collider project at CERN. I led and trained machine learning models using YOLO algorithms to detect anomalies in silicon hexaboards. Additionally, I developed a web application that allows us to upload images taken from the modules after assembly and generate quality reports, complete with filtered images, a label summary table, and histograms. On the basis of this work, we are conducting further studies on silicon detectors, specifically calculating offset during wire bonding. The paper about quality control will be published soon, so stay tuned for the link to my first published work!</p>
								<p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing soccer and cricket, watching movies, traveling, and engaging in deep conversations with friends. As a defensive midfielder in soccer, Iâ€™ve developed quick adaptability, strong analytical thinking, and strategic decision-making skills. Cricket enhances my patience and precision, while watching movies inspires my creativity and offers a cultural escape. Traveling enriches my worldview and allows me to connect with diverse individuals, fostering thought-provoking discussions and lasting friendships. These activities not only provide joy and relaxation but also contribute to my personal growth and understanding of the world around me.</p>
								<p>Coming from a developing country where technological advancement is slow, I have always dreamed of gaining knowledge and experience in the USA to contribute back to my home country. I am particularly concerned about the rising costs of healthcare services. I believe that health is wealth, and everyone deserves access to quality medical care. With my knowledge, I aspire to create automated solutions that can diagnose common symptoms online, providing affordable healthcare options for those in need.</p>
								<p>While my resume may outline my technical qualifications, some of my unique capabilities include being a quick learner, a strong communicator, and sometimes even a therapist to my friends. I tend to be quite stubborn when faced with challenges, as I have a deep-seated determination to solve problems. I also find that I think more clearly when I am alone and at night, often accompanied by music.</p>
								<p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio!</p>
